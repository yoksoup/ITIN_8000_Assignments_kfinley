ITIN 8000, Kyle Finley HW1

This is pseudocode for HW 1
Converted from my flowchart to print the following statements:

“Hello. Todays Date is [Month Name] [Day Number][th/nd/st/rd] of [Year].
The product of the month and day is [Month Number * Day], which is an [Odd/Even] number.

If you counted the days this month so far you would have
[Loop to count up to the current day of the month with each number on a new line] days.”

"""

# Import and assign the year month and day
# Convert string to int
# Create product from day and month

# is the product even or odd?
# display the correct statement

# print days counted statement

# Loop if x != days
# print x, ++x

# print "days"
